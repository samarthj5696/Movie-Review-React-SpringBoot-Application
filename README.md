# Movie-Review-React-SpringBoot-Application
The "Movie Review" project is a web-based application that provides users with a platform to search, review and rate movies. The project is developed using Spring Boot for the backend, React for the frontend and MongoDB for the database.

The backend of the application is developed using Spring Boot, a popular Java-based framework for creating web applications. It provides the necessary tools for building scalable and efficient web services. The backend is responsible for handling user requests, fetching data from the database and returning the appropriate response to the frontend.

The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The UI is designed to be user-friendly, intuitive and responsive. Users can search for movies, view movie details, and write reviews and ratings for the movies.

The database used in the application is MongoDB, a NoSQL database that provides a flexible data model and high scalability. It stores all the movie data including movie details, user reviews, and ratings.

The "Movie Review" project is a great example of a full-stack web application that utilizes modern technologies to provide a seamless user experience. The project is open-source and available on GitHub, making it easy for developers to contribute to the project and extend its functionality.
